# Advent of Code 2021

**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I don't want to put on too much time or pressure, so I quit it on day 3.

"That's it, I'm done!" I said to myself after finishing that first puzzle on my heart. Later, when I finally solved it, I thought: "But I like this code calendar, let's do it on my own terms and finish the calendar on whenever, or what?"

Later that day I read [this tweet from the author](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1467243576966983685):

"If you're doing #AdventOfCode and learning stuff, but your code's a mess, you got the wrong answer, you're a few days behind, it took you several hours, you're in a language you're not familiar with...

All I hear is that you're learning stuff. You're doing great!! 🌟❤️🎄🧑‍🎄"
